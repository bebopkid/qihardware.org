### Community Principles (Draft)

Principles for Growing the Commons. This is a work in progress.

#### 0. Energy and Time are Scarce Resources.

Open Source Software was an energy-less and time-less creation that worked well with the public release and growth of the Internet. The scarcity of energy and time were not considered. Open Source was the freeing of the tools and languages for people to use to be creative in a Utopian play state which allowed the scaling up in the breadth and depth only people could do to connect old concepts to the new possibilities provided by a global communications network, the Internet.

Now, with the birth of web3, post Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, the physical reality is that energy and time are scarce resources. The flow between software and hardware post-cryptocurrency demands a rethinking of Open Source, and creation of a new concept for energy scarce software and hardware development to allow for the rapid freeing of software and hardware developers to create new technology creatively that also connects older concepts, Open Source and Internet, with the new, Cryptocurrency. This new synthesis we call Qi empowers developers to be creative and make results that were impossible to have predicted before.

#### 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR)

#### 2. Grow the Commons (Grow the Blockchain)

The Public Shared Commons of Crypto is the Blockchain. If you are in Ethereum, your commons is the Ethereum Blockchain. If you use Bitcoin, your commons is the Bitcoin Blockchain. The tragedy of the commons is avoided in one way by supporting the growth and security of the commons aka the blockchain.

#### 3. Have Fun, Be friendly

Cryptocurrency development came from fun and play, not scamming and scheming. Let's keep the innovation fun, and friendly. If it starts to become un-fun and un-friendly, then people will move on.

Also, there is a simplicity and beauty to the software side of crypto. This is very much friendly for people. Software beauty comes from a desire for beautiful and pretty code. The point where the software connects with the physical hardware, because the place where there is a connection to a person. The design of the software and hardware together, is made into a human machine interface. Hardware can be dirty, ugly and unfriendly, but if the process of making crypto software is kept fun and friendly, the hardware will come out fun and friendly for people.

#### 4. Financial Liberty and Economic Freedom are a Human Right.

The innovation of cryptocurrency is forever released. And with it, is the innovation that a person may have financial independence from any institution, corporation or mega-corporation. The ability to control ones own resources and do what one wants freely, is a simply a human right.

What about the scammer, the weapons dealer, the human traffickers? Is it the goal of the network to deal with social or democratic emergencies?

#### 5. Like Software, Hardware should be study-able.

Software is not hardware. Software and the Open Source movements goal to provide some transparency in software code for review and openness for anyone to improve or fork is not  simply transferrable to hardware.

There is not much gained in releasing every aspect of making a hardware product because making a hardware product is scarce energy intensive. Requiring the release of every piece of software and pathway to getting to a hardware product is creating a mirage for software developers. The physical world made not be coded by a software programmer, without energy.

Software development is Utopian. Hardware development is based in physical reality. Hardware development requires privacy, secrecy, and focus of energy in order to create a hardware product.

anti-fud / reverse engineering friendly / not ifixit / fud guys go elsewhere (I can study it, I know it) (no more mandate on plans and manufacturing all published...invites mirage, why when you can study and KNOW)

#### 6. education

#### 7. recycling / waste (physical waste is bad, software also creates waste) and software devs have to take responsibility w algorithms and how they effect the world! stop the waste

#### 8. software is intangible. hardware is tangible.

#### 9. software is virtual. hardware is spatial.

#### 10. hardware defines the toolbox of software commands developers may use.

#### 11. KYC is KNOW YOUR CHAIN.


Failure to act is PoW, a prisoner of war of commercial interests and governments.
