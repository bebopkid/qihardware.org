# Fullnode

Here is a "Full node" definition from [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook):
 "[A bitcoin network node with all four functions: wallet, miner, full blockchain database, and network routing](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch08.asciidoc#full_node_reference)"

Actually, any healthy crypto currency should contain all of four of these fundamental functions.

You may use them separately, part of them or combine them to make your product.

For example:

1. __Mining pool__: only use part of full blockchain database, network routing, wallet and miner.

2. __Cryptocurrency trading platform__: only uses wallet.

3. __Block Explorer__: uses full blockchain database.

4. __Hardware wallet__: only use part of the wallet.

The more components used, the more complexity is added.
